## Eat a Burrito

If I was there for an hour it's what I would do.

### Taqueria Cancun (19th & Mission)

In my opinion this is the de facto experience. Go late at night after some drinks.

### La Taqueria (25th & Mission)

This actually did my second favourite burrito in the city but I hear the tacos are the real reason to go. Unlike
a lot of places this is only open until around 9pm.

## Do Brunch Properly (i.e. wait and get drunk)

Grab some sunglasses and stand outside somewhere with a free coffee for an hour waiting to vegetate for
the rest of the day. It's a way of life out there.

### Plow (18th & Texas)

This has become one of the most popular and plush brunch places in the city. I'd recommending getting their
everything meal "The Plow". Also, Mimosas.

### Just For You (3rd & 22nd)

Apparently this place used to be owned by a couple of really mean lesbians. I'm not sure about this
anymore but it's a pretty great place for brunch/lunch. There are mimosas by the pint and some awesome
crab cakes. Pro tip: beignets. They are the best.

### The Sycamore (17th & Sycamore)

This is a bit intense. Bottomless mimosas and fairly decent food. A great way to ruin a day.

## Visit North Beach

North Beach is also referred to as Little Italy. It's one of the oldest parts of the city and is great for a
wonder - especially as it's so close to Chinatown.

### Vesuvio (Columbus Ave. & Jack Kerouac Alley)

Yes that's seriously the street name. This is one of the coolest looking bars in the city. Serves absinthe. This bar
was actually used to film some external shots in "So I Married An Axe Murderer".

### Giordano Bros. (Columbus Ave. & Broadway)

This is a Pittsburgh themed bar that does some amazing "All in One" sandwhiches. By "all in one" they mean bread, fries, cheese, slaw and some kind of meat(s).

## Do Touristy Shit

I never really found SF was as good for sightseeing as I would have thought. There are some things that are cool though.

### Golden Gate

I mean you kind of have to. I like the view from the park at Marina Blvd. & Baker.

### Pacific Ocean (Fulton & Great Hwy)

It's actually in a lot of places but I really like this spot as it really feels like the edge of the city.

### The Ferry Building (The Embarcadero around Market St.)

This building is a really cool place to hang out and look at the bay and the bridge. I'd recommend getting some clam
chowder from Hog Island Oyster Company. The Slanted Door does a great cocktail also.

### Golden Gate Park

It's huge. If you've got some time to kill playing disc golf there is pretty good fun.

### The Armory (14th & Mission)

This is the alternative SF tourist destination. The Armory was a National Guard armory back in the day and
now it's a porn studio owned by BDSM specialists Kink.com. They do a pretty fun/interesting tour that will give you
a quick insight into how relaxed SF is with sexuality. Many people think of it as a rite of passage in SF.

## Drink Coffee

SF likes it's coffee. Expect all mannner of hipsters and equipment in each place.

### Blue Bottle (Mint Plaza)

This is one of the most famous bay area brands. One time I went in and there was a guy making coffee with
what looked like a test tube and a bunsen burner. His moustache was thick. Great coffee in all configuration at many
different prices. The New Orleans style ice coffee is worth a shot.

### Blue Bottle (Webster & 3rd in Oakland)

I believe this is actually the orignal. Another way to stick it to the Oakland haters.

### Fourbarrel (15th & Valencia)

This place became famous for it's dear heads and all vinyl music. The coffee is nice also. They have a single origin
bar as well where someone will take you through choosing your perfect bean.

### Philz (24th & Folsom)

Great for it's huge menu of weird coffees. Actually possible to hang out in also. If I had a venn diagram of
everyone I knew's favourite coffee place then this would probably fall in the center.

## Drink Beer

California has so many breweries. It makes Scotland's indie beer scene look pathetic.

### City Beer Store (8th & Folsom)

One of the weird store/bar beer places in SF. This place has an awesome bottle selection and a cool but small
tap selection. Watch out for their heavily rare, several year old Brew Dogs.

### Southern Pacific Brewery (19th & Treat)

This was the first bar I went to in SF and I always really loved it. Cheap pitchers of their home brews are
the thing to go for here.

### Monk's Kettle (16th & Albion)

This is one of the classier bars in the mission and is pretty expensive but has a great selection. The menu
rotates a lot so is always really interesting. It's pretty small so going while people are at work would be a good
idea.

### 21st Amendment (2nd & Brannan)

Not my favourite bar in SF but the brewery makes some amazing beer and this makes it definitely worth a visit.

### Mikkeller (Mason & Turk)

This place is nothing if not miles up its own arse but the beer selection is always pretty phenomenal. Run
by one of my favourite breweries in the world. Brew Dog are opening a bar for the Danish outfit later in 2014
I believe.

### Pi Bar (25th & Valencia)

$3.14 slices and a great craft beer selection. This place is just indulgence at it's best. Get there
between 3:14 and 6:28 pm for a pint and a slice for $6.28. I know right?

## Eat 'Murican Food

Soul food, bar fair. It's all good.

### Connecticut Yankee (17th & Connecticut)

This place is loved by everyone in Potrero Hill. Used to be favourite place for some Sunday NFL. Nice beers, good brunch
and dinner menus. The fried chicken on the dinner menu and the Joe Montana on the brunch menu are my favourites.

### Hard Knox Cafe (3rd & 22nd)

A soul food restaurant run by a Vietnamese couple from Texas. It's definitely one of my favourite places to
eat in the city. Fried chicken, deep fried pork chop, mac and cheese OMG I'M HUNGRY.

### Little Star Pizza (Divisadero & Fulton)

Chicago-esque style pizzas. These things really align with the "pie" translation of the word. One of my favourite
'pizza' places in the world.

## Got To A Dive Bar

The first time I heard this terminology I wasn't really sure what it meant. It's basically the soul of the
hip SF drinking scene.

### Zeitgeist (Valencie & Duboce Ave.)

Huge beer garden, loads of beers and constantly playing metal. This place is everything I love about
bars in SF. If you hang around late enough a woman will come in from the street and start selling
$5 tamales. It's a whole thing.

### Tempest (5th & Natoma)

I really came to love this place. $2 PBR's or one with a shot of Jim Bean for $5. It has a Street Fighter machine, an
awfully placed pool table and some really freaky artwork. Tempest actually does a sit down and very civil lunch
that while surprising is really worth a try. Especially during work.

### Noc Noc (Haight & Steiner)

Maybe not quite a dive bar but well... I dunno. This place has the craziest interior of any bar I've been
to. There is like a bomb on the roof with like a gas mask or something on it. And everything is like a cave. I don't
know. Just go and be amazed that somewhere has Hobgoblin on tap 5000 miles away from England.

### The 500 Club (17th & Guerrero)

Probably the least quirky bar on the list but also the most definitely in SF. All red lighting and PBR and nuts
on the floor. I loves it.

## Drink Cocktails

One of my huge discoveries while living in SF was that I really liked cocktails. This is the city where I was educated
in booze.

### Bourbon & Branch (Jones & O' Farrell)

This is actually a genuine speak easy - password and everything. I would advise doing it properly and booking ahead
to get a table and the full drinks menu. Although pretentious, the bar staff are actually pretty chill and the drinks
are great. It's hard to think about cocktails in SF without this place coming up.

### Wilson & Wilson Detective Agency (Jones & O' Farrell)

Wilson & Wilson is actually part of Bourbon & Branch but it is run separately. It has a cool concept where you
indulge in a three part cocktail menu that always ends in more drinks. Great after dinner place. Again, book ahead.

### Elixir (16th & Guerrero)

Part cocktail bar, part dive bar. This is a good combination of all SF drinking experiences slap bang in
the middle of the mission.

## Visit Hayes Valley

This is just a great little part of SF.

### Smitten Ice Cream (Octavia & Hayes)

Smitten makes ice cream from scratch, in 5 minutes, using liquid nitrogen. The ice cream is genuinely awesome. The
best flavour I ever had here was Earl Grey and Chocolate Chip. There is a great park next to it to hang out in also.

### Biergarten (Octavia & Fell)

German style beer garden in SF. If you feel like a stein of lager while sitting outside then this is your place.

## Go Up Potrero Hill

I am biased as I used to live here but I think the view from here is the best in the city. Go all the way
up to 20th & Rhode Island for the best view. There is also some great food around 18th & Connecticut.

### Chez Maman (18th & Connecticut)

One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Awesome French food and a fun but intimate vibe. Great for an actual meal
with someone. I'm a big fan of their veal main course.

### Sunflower (18th & Connecticut)

One thing I was surprised by in SF is how much Vietnamese food there was. This place ended up being my favourite.
The garlic noodles and shaken beef seem to be everyone's go to choices here.

### Ruby Wine (18th & Connecticut)

A cool little hang out if you want to drink some good wine. Be prepared to ask questions though as they're going to try
and work out what you like.
